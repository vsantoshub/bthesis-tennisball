Making and running the package
------------------------------

1. Add the directory where this ROS package is located to /opt/ros/cturtle/setup.sh

2. Edit the stereocam.launch file to your desired settings

3. rosmake --rosdep-install stereocam

4. roslaunch stereocam.launch

5. A new topic called stereo/point_cloud should appear
   rostopic list

6. An example subscriber:

     roslaunch stereocam_subscribe.launch


A note about efficiency
-----------------------

The current implementation saves point cloud data to file, then re-loads it and broadcasts it.  This is not a very efficient way of doing things, and may thrash the hard disk somewhat.  A slightly better workaround would be to create a RAM disk, and save the point cloud data there.  

For example:

  su
  mkdir /tmp/ramdisk
  chmod 777 /tmp/ramdisk
  mount -t tmpfs -o size=256M tmpfs /tmp/ramdisk/

then edit sterecam.launch and set the outputdirectory parameter to "/tmp/ramdisk/"
